    "        <li><p><strong>What are your plans for after graduation?</strong><br/>&emsp;I'd like to go into industry, not sure what field just yet (though I have enjoyed Web Dev and Software Engineering so far), but I'm open to anything. Eventually down the road I'd like to get a PhD. but since I'm still not sure as to what I'd like to focus on I will leave that after I've built up my skills more through hands-on industry experience.</p></li>\n",
    "        <li><p><strong>Why did you sign up for this class?</strong><br/>&emsp;I think it's an interesting topic, and if I can get more knowledge of this particular CS area and at the same time knock out some credit for my degree then all the better. Also the lab that I currently work in does Machine Learning on Organic Photovoltaics, but they use random forests and I thought learning about another aspect of Machine Learning (such as Neural Networks) might be a neat thing to do.</p></li>\n",
    "        <li><p><strong>What are some things you hope to learn from this class?</strong><br/>&emsp;More about Neural Networks and Machine Learning models/algorithms in general<p></li>\n",
    "        <li><p><strong>What other classes or experiences do you have with machine learning?</strong><br/>&emsp;None from myself (at least not building models for ML) but I have read some of the literature from work and it seems like really fascinating stuff.</p></li>\n",
